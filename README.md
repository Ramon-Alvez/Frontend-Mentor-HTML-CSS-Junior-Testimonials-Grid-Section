## My process 💻✒

### Built with 🧱🛠

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned 📚

I was really very proud of the result of this challenge, not only because of the ease and speed but the code itself. I thought I managed to organize myself better and also the structure of both HTML and CSS :D.

### Continued development 🚀

My current goal is to finish all the FrontEnd Mentor challenges, to train and learn in the process. After finishing all HTML and CSS challenges, I will start JavaScript lessons.
